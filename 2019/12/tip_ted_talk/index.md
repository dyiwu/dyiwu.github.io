# My practice on review TED talk video clip

No matter what reasons I am interested in TED talks, either the interesting
subject maters or the excellent English speech style. When I am learning
from a desired TED talk, I always need to review it many times to cache the
whole things especially when I use it as training material to improve my
English ability.

TED talk is in 18 minutes length limit usually, but which need the Internet
connection to access it. A bunch of network traffic will be generated when I
am enjoying the video clip repeatedly. If there are network problems, such
as unstable Internet connection or network bandwidth limitations, which
will make me fail to read it.

How come can I download it once and then play it from my laptop as many
times as I wish? The follow-on problem is on the download speed. Direct
download from TED is slow, but the good news is that most TED talk video
has a copy on YouTube and the speed of YouTube is quite well because
YouTube has excellent CDN (Content Delivery Network) support.

Here comes my practice.

1. By searching the desired TED talk’s title in YouTube to find the
corresponding URL in YouTube.
2. Use the free YouTube Downloader & Converter tool [ClipGrap]
(https://clipgrab.org/) to down load the video clip from YouTube.
3. Use to web application [DOWNSUB] (https://downsub.com/) to
download the subtitle files in English and in Traditional Chinses.
4. Use [PotPlayer] (https://potplayer.daum.net/) to enjoy the video clip
with different subtitles such as:

  - First time review - No subtitle
  - Second time review – with Chinese subtitle.
  - Third time review – with English subtitle.
  - Forth time review – No subtitle again.
