Tips about algolia You need to upload index.json files to algolia to activate searching. You could upload the index.json files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better. Algolia Atomic is a good choice. To be compatible with Hugo multilingual mode, you need to upload different index.json for each language to the different index of algolia, such as zh-cn/index.json or fr/index.json… ","date":"2020-03-06","objectID":"/themedoc/theme-documentation-basics/:5:2","tags":["installation","configuration"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Basics","uri":"/themedoc/theme-documentation-basics/"},{"categories":["Theme Document"],"content":"Find out how to create and organize your content quickly and intuitively in LoveIt theme.","date":"2020-03-05","objectID":"/themedoc/theme-documentation-content/","tags":["content","markdown"],"title":"Theme Documentation - Content","uri":"/themedoc/theme-documentation-content/"},{"categories":["Theme Document"],"content":"Find out how to create and organize your content quickly and intuitively in LoveIt theme.

You can reference page resources by the value for Resources.GetMatch or the filepath of the resource relative to the page directory directly. Store resources in the assets directory, which is /assets by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the assets directory. Store resources in the static directory, which is /static by default. The filepath of the resource to reference in the post is relative to the static directory. The priority of references is also in the above order.

To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy.

Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

With RDP, you can log in to the remote machine and create a real desktop session the same as if you had logged in to a local machine. Installing Xrdp Xrdp is available in the EPEL software repository. If EPEL is not enabled on your system, enable it by typing: # dnf install epel-release Install the Xrdp package: # dnf install xrdp Start up and enable at boot When the installation process is complete, start the Xrdp service and enable it at boot: # systemctl enable xrdp --now Verify the xrdp status # systemctl status xrdp ● xrdp.service - xrdp daemon Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/xrdp.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: active (running) since Sat 2020-05-16 13:31:09 CST; 12s ago Docs: man:xrdp(8) man:xrdp.ini(5) Main PID: 9174 (xrdp) Tasks: 1 (limit: 26213) Memory: 1.0M CGroup: /system.slice/xrdp.service └─9174 /usr/sbin/xrdp --nodaemon Configuring xrdp The configuration files are located in the /etc/xrdp directory. For basic Xrdp connections, you do not need to make any changes to the configuration files. Xrdp uses the default X Window desktop, which in this case, is Gnome. The main configuration file is named xrdp.ini. This file is divided into sections and allows you to set global configuration settings such as security and listening addresses and create different xrdp login sessions. Whenever you make any changes to the configuration file you need to restart the Xrdp service: # systemctl restart xrdp Xrdp uses startwm.sh file to launch the X session. If you want to use another X Window desktop, edit this file. Configuring Firewall By default, xrdp listens on port 3389 on all interfaces. If you run a firewall on your CentOS machine (which you should always do), you’ll need to add a rule to allow traffic on the Xrdp port. Typically you would want to allow access to the Xrdp server only from a specific IP address or IP range. For example, to allow connections only from the 192.168.1.0/24 range, enter the following command: # firewall-cmd --new-zone=xrdp --permanent # firewall-cmd --zone=xrdp --add-port=3389/tcp --permanent # firewall-cmd --zone=xrdp --add-source=192.168.1.0/24 --permanent # firewall-cmd --reload To allow traffic to port 3389 from anywhere use the commands below. Allowing access from anywhere is highly discouraged for security reasons. # firewall-cmd --add-port=3389/tcp --permanent # firewall-cmd --reload For increased security, you may consider setting up Xrdp to listen only on localhost and creating an SSH tunnel that securely forwards traffic from your local machine on port 3389 to the server on the same port. Another secure option is to install OpenVPN and connect to the Xrdp server trough the private network. Connecting to the Xrdp Server Now that the Xrdp server is configured, it is time to open your local Xrdp client and connect to the remote CentOS 8 system. Windows users can use the default RDP client. Type “remote” in the Windows search bar and click on “Remote Desktop Connection”. This will open up the RDP client. In the “Computer” field, type the remote server IP address and click “Connect”. On the login screen, enter your username and password and click “OK”. Once logged in, you should see the default Gnome desktop. You can now start interacting with the remote desktop from your local machine using your keyboard and mouse.

范蠡（lǐ）（前536年7月26日－前448年），字少伯，又名鴟夷子皮、陶朱公，早年居楚時，尚未出仕，人稱范伯。以經商致富，廣為世人所知，後代許多生意人皆供奉他的塑像，稱之財神。傳說佐越王勾踐定計滅吳後與西施泛五湖而去，事見《越絕書》《吳越春秋》。范蠡，堪稱歷史上棄政從商的鼻祖和開創個人致富記錄的典範。《史記》中載\"累十九年三致金，財聚巨萬”，當然入選，推薦為\"中國十大富豪\"之首。 范蠡在助楚王勾踐滅吳後，棄官經商，不久發家致富，富可敵國又傾財賑民，並助人致富的社會責任感，即便在今天亦堪為楷模，挖掘並發揚\"商聖\"的商略、商德、商文化，後人歸納出范蠡的\"經商十八忌”。 陶朱公范蠡著有《陶朱商經十八法》，分為三謀和三略，是為：人謀，事謀，物謀；貨略，價略，市略；這三謀三略，乃陶朱商經十八法之要義。後世還流傳有陶朱公《商訓》、陶朱致富《十二戒》等。

人謀 用人要正，忠奸定興廢。 大事要慎，妄托受大害。 待人忌躁，暴躁交易少。 處事宜靜，浮躁誤事多。 言行宜和，和氣能生財。 做事宜勤，懶惰百事廢。 事謀 用度宜儉，奢華財源敗。 做工宜精，粗糙出劣品。 貨期要准，馬虎失信用。 交易要速，拖延失良機。 進貨要嚴，濫入貨價減。 出納要謹，潦草差錯多。 物謀 優劣要清，混淆耗損大。 存物要整，散漫難查點。 價格要明，含糊多爭執。 賒欠要審，濫出虧血本。 帳目要清，糊塗弊端生。 查帳要勤，懈怠滯本金。 三略：貨略、價略、市略 積著之理，務完物，審貴賤，無息幣。 范蠡說的\"三略\"是聚財的原理，他歸納為三點：務完物，審貴賤，無息幣。意思是說，貨物的品質要完美，要注意價格變化規律，莫要使貨幣停止流動。 務完物是《貨略》的核心。 他說：“以物相貿易， 而食之貨勿留，無敢居貴。” 審貴賤是《價略》的核心，價格問題頗為複雜。 範蠡主要強調：“論其有餘不足則貴賤之。貴上極則反賤，賤下極則反貴。貴出如糞土，賤取如珠玉。“范蠡說的價格原理，就是貨物供求關係的有餘與不足；他指出了價格變化中物極必反的規律，“貴出如糞土，賤取如珠玉\"乃是範蠡經營商業的名言。 《市略》講資本金營運策略。 範蠡的\"無息幣\"就是說貨物、資金都要不停地迴圈，運轉。他說，如此\"則幣欲其行如流水。“幣即錢，錢即泉，川流不息，乃至大匯。

于已有利而於人無利者，小商也；于已有利而于人亦有利者，大商也；于人有利，於已無利者，非商也；損人之利以利已之利者，奸商也。 大商之經商，有如伊尹，薑子牙之于治國；孫子，吳起之於用兵；商鞅之於變法；其學問之精深，道法之玄奧，意氣之宏遠，境界之高明，豈是空想妄論之輩，俚諺俗語所能達到的。 大凡天下之學問，萬事成敗，皆不出道與術這兩大範疇。道是河，術是舟；道是舵，術是槳。無河無以載舟，無舟難以渡河。無舵則無方向，無槳則無動力。所以，道是方向，術是方法；道是法則，術是謀略。謀者，韜略也，漢書藝文志雲：謀略，以正守國，以奇用兵，先計而後戰，天下之謀略，無論應用於何時何事，時謀，地謀，人謀這三則。 “兩權相害取其輕！” “無事時如有事般提防，方可彌意外之變；有事時如無事般鎮定，才能消局中之危。” 在經商的過程中，或是日常生活中，如果利益雙方得不到平衡，那麼就會產生矛盾和衝突，如果矛盾和衝突得不到合理的解決辦法，那麼最終誰的目的都達不到。 予，就是合理解決這一矛盾衝突的最好辦法。通過這個辦法，解決了利益各方之間的平衡，最後達到了取的目的。 逞強蠻幹是絕不行的，一個成功的商人，首先要懂得商道之本，還要善於審時度勢，溝通權變，要善於聯繫各色人物，調和各種矛盾，明辨禍福利弊，也要善於轉輸貨物，商略價格，拓展市場。只有這樣，才能在商海中立於不敗之地！下棋的最高境界是和棋！利緣義取，大商無算。

茄子切開後要立即下鍋或者放入水中，不然茄子會被氧化成黑色。炒茄子時適量放些醋，炒出來的茄子顏色不會發黑； 炒雞蛋時，一個蛋加一湯匙溫水攪勻，就不會炒老，而且炒出的蛋量多，鬆軟可口； 豆腐下鍋前，可先放在開水裡浸潤十分鐘，這樣可清除豆味和鹼味； 要燉出一鍋好魚湯，要用冷水。冷水開鍋後，撇凈浮沫，能去除魚腥味，同時魚肉蛋白慢慢凝固，營養物質可以充分地“釋放”到魚湯中。喝濃湯要大火燉，喝清湯則用小火； 蒸魚或蒸肉時，待蒸鍋的水開了以後再上蒸籠，能使魚或肉外部突然遇到高溫蒸氣而立即收縮，內部鮮汁不外流，熟後味道更鮮美； 熬骨頭湯時，中途切勿加冷水，以免湯的溫度突然下降導致蛋白質和脂肪迅速凝固，影響營養和味道，最好一次加滿水或者中途加適量開水； 煮肉時，如果想使湯味鮮美，應該把肉放進冷水中慢慢煮；如果想使肉味鮮美，則應該把肉放在熱水中煮； 熬豬油時，先在鍋內放入少量水，再將切好的豬板油放入，這樣熬出來的油，顏色晶亮而無雜質； 將切好的豬肉片放在漏勺裡，在沸水中晃幾下，待肉剛變色時就起水，瀝幹水分，然後下鍋炒，幾分鐘即熟，鮮嫩可口； 將蝦仁放入碗內，加一點精鹽，食用鹼粉，用手抓搓一會兒後用清水浸泡，然後再用清水洗凈，這樣能使炒出的蝦仁透明如水晶瑩，爽嫩可口； 燒葷菜時,在加了酒後，再加點醋，菜就變得香噴噴的;燒素菜時，適當加點醋，味道好營養也好，因為醋對維生素有保護作用； 蔬菜儘可能做到現炒現吃，避免長時間保溫和多次加熱，以避免維生素損失和味道變差； 帶魚身上的腥味和油膩較大，用清水很難洗凈，可把帶魚放在鹼水中泡一下，再用清水洗，就會很容易洗凈，而且無腥味； 炒牛肉片前，用啤酒將麵粉調稀，淋在牛肉片上，拌勻醃30分鐘，讓啤酒中的酶使蛋白質分解，以增加牛肉的鮮嫩度； 腰花切好後，加少許白醋，用水浸泡10分鐘，腰花會發大，無血水，炒熟後清嫩爽口； 炒豬肝前，用白醋和水浸泡一下，再用清水沖洗乾淨，炒熟的豬肝口感特好； 豆芽鮮嫩，炒時速度要快。若在炒時放一點醋，則能除豆芽的澀味，並且還能保持其爽脆鮮嫩； 甜椒要用急火快炒。炒時加少許精鹽、醋，炒幾下即可出鍋； 用冷鍋冷油炒花生米，酥而不變色、不脫衣； 夏季做各種涼拌菜時，加適量啤酒調拌，可增味添香。 ","date":"2019-09-03","objectID":"/2019/09/22-cooking-tips/:0:0","tags":["recipe","食"],"title":"22 Cooking

庫藏股的回購往往作為對股東的回報，但比直接發放紅利更省稅。公司在分析認為自己股票價格偏低時也往往會進行庫藏股回購，作為一種融資手段。庫藏股還可用於刺激與提高自己公司股票的交易量與股價。庫藏股也可以用於提供公司內部的股票期權等員工福利。 庫藏股與普通股相比有如下限制： 庫藏股不分享紅利。 庫藏股在股東投票時不計入內。 庫藏股總價值不能超過公司資本的5%。 在購回庫藏股後，公司可以選擇註銷（註銷後將不再填報到資產負債表上），或者持有以待股價上升後售出。一般來說公司購回庫藏股後，由於發行股票總數減少，可能會刺激股價上升。有些投資者也把公司回購庫藏股作為一個信號，即該股價可能偏低。 在公司財會帳務上，通常有兩種辦法計算庫藏股。 一種是按成本入帳，將庫藏股的回購與再售出作為一次交易對待。當購回庫藏股時，資產負債表上實收資本這一項要按所支付的成本相應減少。在庫藏股被賣出時，再根據實際售出情況相應調整。 另一種是按面值入帳，將庫藏股的回購於售出/註銷看作兩次交易，分別按實際交易情況或貸記或借記。 Reference: 維基百科-庫藏股

MACD指標的一般研判標準主要是圍繞快速和慢速兩條均線及紅、綠柱線狀況和它們的形態展開。一般分析方法主要包括DIF和MACD值及它們所處的位置、DIF和MACD的交叉情況、紅柱狀的收縮情況和MACD圖形的形態這四個大的方面分析。 1、DIF和MACD的值及線的位置： 當DIF和MACD均大於0（即在圖形上表示為它們處於零線以上）並向上移動時，一般表示為股市處於多頭行情中，可以買入或持股； 當DIF和MACD均小於0（即在圖形上表示為它們處於零線以下）並向下移動時，一般表示為股市處於空頭行情中，可以賣出股票或觀望。 當DIF和MACD均大於0（即在圖形上表示為它們處於零線以上）但都向下移動時，一般表示為股票行情處於退潮階段，股票將下跌，可以賣出股票和觀望； 當DIF和MACD均小於0時（即在圖形上表示為它們處於零線以下）但向上移動時，一般表示為行情即將啟動，股票將上漲，可以買進股票或持股待漲。 2、DIF和MACD的交叉情況： 當DIF與MACD都在零線以上，而DIF向上突破MACD時，表明股市處於一種強勢之中，股價將再次上漲，可以加碼買進股票或持股待漲，這就是MACD指標「黃金交叉」的一種形式。 當DIF和MACD都在零線以下，而DIF向上突破MACD時，表明股市即將轉強，股價跌勢已盡將止跌朝上，可以開始買進股票或持股，這是MACD指標「黃金交叉」的另一種形式。 當DIF與MACD都在零線以上，而DIF卻向下突破MACD時，表明股市即將由強勢轉為弱勢，股價將大跌，這時應賣出大部分股票而不能買股票，這就是MACD指標的「死亡交叉」的一種形式。 當DIF和MACD都在零線以上，而DIF向下突破MACD時，表明股市將再次進入極度弱市中，股價還將下跌，可以再賣出股票或觀望，這是MACD指標「死亡交叉」的另一種形式。 3、MACD指標中的柱狀圖分析： 在股市電腦分析軟體中（如錢龍軟體）通常採用DIF值減DEA（即MACD、DEM）值而繪製成柱狀圖，用紅柱狀和綠柱狀表示，紅柱表示正值，綠柱表示負值。用紅綠柱狀來分析行情，既直觀明了又實用可靠。 當紅柱狀持續放大時，表明股市處於牛市行情中，股價將繼續上漲，這時應持股待漲或短線買入股票，直到紅柱無法再放大時才考慮賣出。 當綠柱狀持續放大時，表明股市處於熊市行情之中，股價將繼續下跌，這時應持幣觀望或賣出股票，直到綠柱開始縮小時才可以考慮少量買入股票。 當紅柱狀開始縮小時，表明股市牛市即將結束（或要進入調整期），股價將大幅下跌，這時應賣出大部分股票而不能買入股票。 當綠柱狀開始收縮時，表明股市的大跌行情即將結束，股價將止跌向上（或進入盤整），這時可以少量進行長期戰略建倉而不要輕易賣出股票。 當紅柱開始消失、綠柱開始放出時，這是股市轉市信號之一，表明股市的上漲行情（或高位盤整行情）即將結束，股價將開始加速下跌，這時應開始賣出大部分股票而不能買入股票。 當綠柱開始消失、紅柱開始放出時，這也是股市轉市信號之一，表明股市的下跌行情（或低位盤整）已經結束，股價將開始加速上升，這時應開始加碼買入股票或持股待漲。 4、MACD的特殊分析方法： 形態法則：M頭W底等形態 MACD指標的研判還可以從MACD圖形的形態來幫助研判行情。 當MACD的紅柱或綠柱構成的圖形雙重頂底（即M頭和W底）、三重頂底等形態時，也可以按照形態理論的研判方法來加以分析研判。例如： 頂背離和底背離 MACD指標的背離就是指MACD指標的圖形的走勢正好和K線圖的走勢方向正好相反。MACD指標的背離有頂背離和底背離兩種。 頂背離 當股價K線圖上的股票走勢一峰比一峰高，股價一直在向上漲，而MACD指標圖形上的由紅柱構成的圖形的走勢是一峰比一峰低，即當股價的高點比前一次的高點高、而MACD指標的高點比指標的前一次高點低，這叫頂背離現象。頂背離現象一般是股價在高位即將反轉轉勢的信號，表明股價短期內即將下跌，是賣出股票的信號。 底背離 底背離一般出現在股價的低位區。當股價K線圖上的股票走勢，股價還在下跌，而MACD指標圖形上的由綠柱構成的圖形的走勢是一底比一底高，即當股價的低點比前一次低點底，而指標的低點卻比前一次的低點高，這叫底背離現象。底背離現象一般是預示股價在低位可能反轉向上的信號，表明股價短期內可能反彈向上，是短期買入股票的信號。 在實踐中，MACD指標的背離一般出現在強勢行情中比較可靠，股價在高價位時，通常只要出現一次背離的形態即可確認位股價即將反轉，而股價在低位時，一般要反覆出現幾次背離後才能確認。因此，MACD指標的頂背離研判的準確性要高於底背離，這點投資者要加以留意。

而KD值另外一個常使用的判斷方式是根據公式KD值都會朝向同一個趨勢發展，但K值反應市場價格的速度較D值來的快，波動亦較D值來的大，所以當K值與D值交叉時被稱為黃金交叉或死亡交叉，是買進或賣出的指標訊號。 判斷方法如下 K值由下而上穿越D值 為黃金交叉，行情看好。 K值由上而下穿越D值 為死亡交叉，行情看差。 RSV 是英文Raw Stochastic

施昇輝表示，利用KD值買賣，當然並非鐵板一塊， 如果手上資金充裕，不用非得等到日KD值20才買進， 在30或40以下，就可以買進，越跌越買，建立部位； 若是手頭資金不多，那才要等到20再買進。 至於賣出，施昇輝表示，他通常看到日K值往下，尚未穿過D值，形成「死亡交叉」時， 就開始執行賣出。施昇輝並強調，尤其大盤跌破季線，就代表進入空頭， 一旦反彈到季線時，就要開始賣出，不要等到死亡交叉才賣，否則可能來去又是一場空。 KD值落點 施施昇輝的操作方法 韋恩史達克的操作方法 90 以上 每週賣 5-8 張 每週賣 3 張 90 - 80 每週賣 3-5 張 每週賣 2 張 79 - 60 每週賣 2-3 張 每週賣 1 張 59 - 40 每週買 2-3 張 每週買 1 張 39 - 20 每週買 3-5 張 每週買 2 張 20 以下

作為國君，最重要的是懷有仁慈的心。 作為臣子，最重要的則是忠誠。 為人父，最重要的是慈愛；為人子，最要緊的則是孝道。 作人的兄長，最要緊的是友愛弟妹；作為弟妹，則要恭敬兄長。 作丈夫的，最重要的是態度平和，作妻子的，則必須重視溫柔的作用。 與師長相處，最重要的是合乎禮；與朋友相交，最重要的則是講信用。 遇見老者，當有尊敬之心；看見幼者，當有慈愛之心。 對品德高尚的人，雖然年紀比我小，我也應當尊敬他； 對那些素行不端者，雖年紀比我大，我們也該離他遠點。 千萬不要談論別人的短處，更不可以仗侍著自己的長處而自以為了不起。 對人有恨意，化解之道就在於檢查自己是否站在合於道義的一方； 對於那些自己所怨恨的人，則應以平直的心態，正常地對待他們。 隨便遇到什麼樣的環境，都當心平氣和地接受。 別人有小過錯，則應有包容之心；別人犯了較大的過錯，則應將正確合理的作法明白告訴他。 不要以為只是一件小小的善事而不去做，更不可以認為是小小的壞事而大膽地去做。 別人的缺點，(面對他人時)我們應幫他稍加掩蓋；別人的優點，則應該幫他宣揚。 處世不應為了私事而與人結仇；治家更要注意不可因為私心而有不公平的作法。 不要做損人利己的事，不要有妒賢嫉能的心態。 遇到不順的事情，切勿因氣憤而求一時之快；不要違背正常的行為規範而去傷害別的物體。 遇有不合正義的發財機會，則應該放棄；遇到合情合理的事情，則不妨從事。 古聖先賢所流傳下來的經典，不可以不讀； 待人的合理規範與處世的正當態度，則不可不知。 對後代子孫，不能不重視教育；對僕人幫傭，則必須能體諒關懷。 數千年的文化傳統不可不尊敬；遇到災變打擊，則不可不相互扶持。 謹守本分，必須有賴於了解做人的基本規範；而我們一生的命運，則是由老天來決定。 一個人能做到以上各點，則老天必定會來相助的。 這些基本的道理，都是日常生活中隨處可做的。 就像衣服之於身體，飲食之於口腹，是每天都不可離開，每天都不可缺少的。 我們對這些基本的生活道理，怎可不重視呢？

(原文)：黎明即起，灑掃庭除，要內外整潔；既昏便息，關鎖門戶，必親自檢點。 (白話)：每天早晨，天剛微亮的時候，就要起床！那時屋子裏面還是黑暗的，先用水來灑濕堂前階下一帶地方的灰塵，然後用帚掃地！房子的裏面和外面都要整齊清潔。已經到了黃昏的時，便要休息；睡覺以前，門戶有要關的，或要鎖的，必須自己去查看一下。 (原文)：一粥一飯，當思來處不易；半絲半縷，恆念物力維艱。 (白話)：我們對於所吃的一頓粥，或一頓飯，應當想著它的所以得來是不容易的；對於衣服的半根絲或半條線，也要常念著這些物資的產生是很艱難的。 (原文)：宜未雨而綢繆！毋臨渴而掘井！ (白話)：凡事先要準備，像沒到下雨的時候，要先把房子修補完善，不要「臨時抱佛腳」，像到了口渴的時候，才來掘井。 (原文)：自奉必須儉約！宴客切勿留連！ (白話)：自己享受，必須約節！請客來吃酒，食切不可沒有限度！ (原文)：器具質而潔，瓦缶勝金鈺；飲食約而精，園蔬愈珍饈。 (白話)：飲食用具，質樸結實，又洗得乾淨，雖然用泥土做的瓦器，也比金玉製的好些。飲食的東西，節約而做得精美，就是園裏種的蔬菜，也勝於珍貴的肴饌。 (原文)：勿營華屋！勿謀良田！ (白話)：不要營造華麗的房屋！不要圖買良好的田園！ (原文)：三姑六婆，實淫盜之媒；婢美妾嬌，非閨房之福。 (白話)：三姑和六婆，都是姦淫和盜竊的媒介；美麗的婢女和嬌豔的姬妾，不是家庭的幸福。 (原文)：童僕勿用俊美！妻妾切忌豔妝！ (白話)：家僮、奴僕，不可僱用俊美貌的！妻、妾切不可有豔麗的妝飾！ (原文)：祖宗雖遠，祭祀不可不誠；子孫雖愚，經書不可不讀。 (白話)：祖宗雖然年代久遠了，祭祀卻要虔誠的舉行；子孫雖是笨拙的，五經、四書，卻要誦讀，並要把其中的「微言大義」，記在心裏，做為世的方針。 (原文)：居身務期儉樸；教子要有義方。 (白話)：自己做人，要節儉樸實；教訓兒子們要有合宜的方法，使他們有向義的志趣。 (原文)：莫貪意外之財，莫飲過量之酒！ (白話)：不要貪不義的財！不要喝過量的酒！ (原文)：與肩挑貿易，毋佔便宜！見窮苦親鄰，須加溫卹！ (白話)：和做小生意的挑販們交易，不要佔他們的便宜！看到窮苦的親戚或鄰人們，要溫慰他們，並且要對他們有金錢或其他的援助！ (原文)：刻薄成家，理無久享；倫常乖舛，立見消亡。 (白話)：對人刻薄而起家的，決沒有長久享受的道理。亂了倫常的人，會立刻見到滅亡的。 (原文)：兄弟叔姪，須分多潤寡！長幼內外，宜法肅辭嚴！ (白話)：兄和弟，叔和姪的中間，要把多的分出來，補助少的。一家人裏，老的、少的、女的、男的，應有嚴正的規矩和莊重的言辭。 (原文)：聽婦言，乖骨肉，豈是丈夫？重貲財，薄父母，不成人子。 (白話)：聽信婦人數挑撥話，而傷了骨肉之親的感情，那裏配做一個大丈夫呢？看重錢財，而薄待父母，不是作兒子的道理。 (原文)：嫁女擇佳婿，毋索重聘！娶媳求淑女，勿計厚奩！ (白話)：嫁女兒，要為她選擇賢良的夫婿，不要索取貴重的聘禮！娶媳婦，須求賢淑的女子，不要貪圖豐厚的妝奩！ (原文)：見富貴而生諂容者，最可恥；遇貧窮而作驕態者，賤莫甚。 (白話)：看到富貴的人，便做出諂媚的樣子，是最可恥的；遇著貧窮的人，便裝起驕傲的態度，是鄙賤不過的。 (原文)：居家戒爭訟，訟則終凶；處世戒多言，言多必失。 (白話)：人們住家，要慎防爭鬥訴訟！因為訴訟，無論勝敗，總要傷財耗時，甚至破家蕩產，所以結果總是凶多吉少的。處世，不可多說話！話說多了，總難免有失當的地方。 (原文)：勿持勢力而凌逼孤寡！毋貪口腹而恣殺牲禽！ (白話)：不可恃勢力來欺陵壓迫孤兒寡婦！不要貪口腹之慾而任意的屠殺牛羊雞鴨等物！ (原文)：乖僻自是，悔誤必多；頹惰自甘，家道難成。 (白話)：性情乖張古怪，卻自以為是的人，做錯了事情，終於懊悔，一定是多的。甘心頹廢，自暴自棄的人，是難成家立業的。 (原文)：狎暱惡少，久必受其累；屈志老成，急則可相依。 (白話)：親近不良的少年，日子久了，必然會受牽累。屈意敬奉老練有德的人，遇到急難的時候，就可以靠他指導或扶助。 (原文)：輕聽發言，安知非人之譖愬？當忍耐三思！因事相爭，焉知非我之不是？須平心再想！ (白話)：聽人向你說話，不考察他的用意，便相信它？怎知道他不是來說人的壞話呢？總要忍氣耐煩的再三思考！因為一點事情起了口角，怎知不是我自己的不對？必須平心靜氣的自己反省！ (原文)：施惠無念！受恩莫忘！ (白話)：對人施了恩惠，不要記在心裏而望酬報！受了人的惠，不要了報答！ (原文)：凡事當留餘地，得意不宜往。 (白話)：無論做什麼事，當留有餘的地步；得意以後，就要知足，不應該再進一步。 (原文)：人有喜慶，不可生妒忌心！人有禍患，不可生幸心！ (白話)：他人有了喜歡吉慶的事情，不可有妒忌的意思！人有了禍患的時候，不可有幸災樂禍的心腸！ (原文)：善欲人見，不是真善；惡恐人知，便是大惡。 (白話)：做了好事，而想他人看見，就：是沽名釣譽，不是真正的行善。做了事，而怕他人佑道，就是有意做大惡，不是偶然做了的壞事。 (原文)：見色而起心，報在妻女！匿而用暗箭，禍延子孫！ (白話)：：看到美貌的女性而起邪心的，將來報應，恐怕要在己的妻女身上呢！懷恨在心而暗中用計傷害人的，將會替自己的子孫留下禍根！ (原文)：家門和順，雖饔餐不繼，亦有餘歡；國課早完，即囊橐無餘，自得至樂。 (白話)：家裏和氣干安，雖然窮得吃不飽，也是令人覺得多喜歡的。錢和其他要納稅捐，趕快的繳完，即使袋子裏沒有剩餘的錢也會自然得到極大的快樂。 (原文)：讀書志在聖賢，非徒科第。為官心存君國，豈計身家？ (白話)：讀古人的書，要有志氣來學聖賢的行為，不止為了科舉的及第；做一個官吏，要有忠君愛國的思想，怎麼可以計謀自己和家人的享受？ (原文)：守分安命；順時聽天。 (白話)：我們守住本分去工作，守份安命，不妄求；順時勢以進行，聽自然的成就。 (原文)：為人若此，庶乎近焉。 (白話)：如果能夠這樣的做人，那就差不多和聖賢做人的道理相合了。

新的校訓。這十句話傳播神速，在不少年輕人裡瘋傳。 請轉傳給您的子孫，親友，第八,九,十句話也可提醒年長者注重保健。 第一句話， 結交“兩個朋友”： 一個是圖書館，一個是運動場。到運動場鍛煉身體， 強健體魄。到圖書館博覽群書，不斷的“充電”、“蓄電”、“放電”。 第二句話， 培養“兩種功夫”： 一個是本分，一個是本事。 做人靠本分， 做事靠本事。靠“兩本”起家靠得住。 第三句話， 樂於吃“兩樣東西”：一個是吃虧，一個是吃苦。 做人不怕吃虧， 做事不怕吃苦。吃虧是福，吃苦是福。 第四句話， 具備“兩種力量”：一種是思想的力量，一種是利劍的力量。 思想的力量往往戰勝利劍的力量，這是拿破崙的名言。一個人的思想走多遠，他就有可能走多遠。 第五句話， 追求“兩個一致”：一個是興趣與事業一致，一個是愛情與婚姻一致。 興趣與事業一致，就能使你的潛力最大限度地得以發揮。 恩格斯說，婚姻要以愛情為基礎。沒有愛情的婚姻是不道德的婚姻。也不會是牢固的婚姻 第六句話， 插上“兩個翅膀”：一個叫理想，一個叫毅力。 如果一個人有了這“兩個翅膀”，他就能飛得高，飛得遠。 第七句話， 構建“兩個支柱”：一個是科學，一個是人文。 第八句話， 配備兩個“保健醫生”：一個叫運動，一個叫樂觀。 運動使你生理健康，樂觀使你心理健康。日行萬步路，夜讀十頁書。 第九句話， 記住“兩個秘訣”：健康的秘訣在早上，成功的秘訣在晚上。愛因斯坦說過：人的差異產生於業餘時間。業餘時間能成就一個人，也能毀滅一個人。 第十句話， 追求“兩個極致”：一個是把自身的潛力發揮到極致，一個是把自己的壽命健康延長到極致。 這十句話，讀來確實有道理，因而與您分享。

(轉載一篇值得省思的故事) 英國回來，有朋友問，台灣和英國的發展相差多少年？ 還真的回答不了這個問題—— 這涉及到歷史，政治，經濟，文化和教育等等諸多因素。…… 有一個聽來的故事，或許可以幫助了解一下這個問題。 一對在英國愛丁堡工作了一輩子的退休老夫婦準備賣了房到西班牙去養老。 英國四面環海，氣候潮濕，老人易患風濕病。 他在西班牙看中了房子，兩周內必須付款，就在愛丁堡的房屋中介所掛了房子說是“急賣”。 一對台灣年輕夫婦正好剛在這個城市找了工作，孩子要上學，急著買房。 看了中介掛出的房屋照片和價格，怦然心動-無論是地段還是房屋的品質都是他們希望的那樣。 年輕人注意到了“房屋急售”的字樣，就電話中介 “可以優惠嗎？” 老夫婦想著西班牙已經定好並急著要付款的房屋，說 “可以的”。 於是房價被砍了第一刀。 年輕人覺得還是有降價空間。 在簽購房合同的前兩天，突然說這個價格太高不能接受， 不買了，除非價格上再降一個較大的幅度。 沒有想到，老夫婦居然在討論後同意了！ 年輕人心中大喜過望，差不多白菜價買了幢難得的好房子，馬上可以拎包入住。 搬家那天，很多朋友來幫忙。 一走進院中，大出意料之外，綠草如茵，鮮花盛開， 就想主人才剛剛離開，還保有原貌。 推開房門，年輕人幾乎不相信自己的眼睛。 房子一塵不染，窗明幾凈，桌子上還有鮮花， 花瓶壓著一張紙條，上面寫著 : “非常歡迎你們入住這座記錄了我們幾十年幸福生活的房子。 希望你們接下來的生活也和我們一樣幸福安康！” 走進廚房，打開冰箱，裡面吃的喝的都有。 冰箱貼也壓著紙條，說 “冰箱裡給你們準備了一周的食物， 超市要開車出門左拐再左拐，大約有20多分鐘可以到達”。 年輕人開始沉思了，房子有這樣賣的嗎？ 再看電表箱上也有一字條，上面寫著 “我們已經給你們預留了至少一個月的電費， 這個時間，可以幫到你們辦理相關更名手續。 在英國，辦理這類手續是非常麻煩的。” 年輕人徹底愣住了！ 他站在那裡呆住了許久時間… “成人之美” 與 “趁人之危”， “錦上添花” 與 “落井下石”， 這些概念一時攪得他目瞪口呆手足無措。 這時的他，已經全然沒有了喬遷之喜。 如果有一天我們也能做到這樣，我們與發達國家就沒有太大的距離了！ 讓步，是尊重，更是涵養！ 懂得為親人讓步，為朋友讓步，為愛人讓步，這是我們可能做得到的。 而能為素昧平生的人讓步;這種胸襟，我們落後人家太多了! 發達國家與發展中國家的區別不是有錢沒錢的區別，而是人的素質的差異，只有全民素質的提高才能稱得上是發達國家。 我拜讀此文後深受感動，國人的素質急待提高，在台灣你主動吃虧別人會說你傻，你是豬頭。 再次轉發此文供人閱讀！ 再次評論：國人如果把占便宜當成人生的第一要義！ 這個民族的內心依然是貧困的！ 這個民族的素質依然是低下的！ 這個民族的外在依然是卑微的！ (轉載一篇值得省思的故事)

In the rare case you might need to escape (i.e., prevent from executing) a shortcode in a Hugo markdown (.md) file, and display the shortcode as {{\u003c myshortcode \u003e}} you will probably find that escaping the double curly braces with \\ is not working for this, producing a result similar to this {{\u003c myshortcode \u003e}} or this {{\u003c myshortcode \u003e}} or that the shortcode is executed nevertheless. A simple method that works at the time of writing, is adding /* after the opening double curly braces and the angle bracket or percent sign (i.e., {{\u003e/* or {{% and adding */ after the closing angle bracket or percent sign and double curly braces (i.e., */\u003e``}} or %}}). So, if for example, you have the shortcode myshortcode and you want to use it to a code highlight without being executed during page building from the Hugo engine, you should try including it in your markdown file as: ```md {{\u003c/* myshortcode */\u003e}} ``` The above will produce an output like the following: {{}} References for further reading: Escaping Hugo shortcodes How is the Hugo Doc site showing shortcodes in code blocks?

Bad News: Cannot use the Kernel Stack when interrupted on the ICS. When this behavior occurs, a \"panic: Bad News!\" message will be generated followed by a stack trace that includes an entry for \"tcp_rput+0x22a0\". Root Cause ---------- The defect (JAGaf71680) is about the kernel panic due to an uninitialized variable scid in tcp_rput() function. On IPF platform, compiler has been enhanced which causes more speculative loads. For any speculative loads, IPF will leave Nat bit set in register it was trying to load when the load fails. However, since it's speculative load, it does not cause panic immediately and NaT bit is left set. Later in any other functions/subsystems, if compiler allocates un-initialized variable in to the same register where NaT bit was already set by other function/subsystem and is used, it can cause the system crash. Action Plan ----------- This fix is on PHNE_38679, which has been replaced by PHNE_39387 Regarding there is a depndency on IP filter product, please install the follows.

Size down kernel parameter dbc_max_pct from 50 to 20, to free more memory for application process usage.

When the driver finds that the target device is going to the Data Phase erroneously, it transfers two bytes at a time and tries to get the device to an expected phase before aborting the command. Since narrow devices transfer only one byte at a time, there is a possibility that the target device may change phase after transferring one byte resulting in phase mismatch. The phase mismatch handler in the driver adjusts the data address by one which results in an odd byte aligned address. Later, when this address was accessed, the system panicked with an alignment fault.
